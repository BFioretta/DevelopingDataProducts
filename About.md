This is the "Choose the best car for you" application.  It was created for the Developing Data Products Course, from Coursera. This application allows the user to find the best car for them based on their selections for Transmission type, Cylinder, MPG and HP preferences.  The application utilizes the mtcars dataset.  

* First, use the radio buttons to select whether you prefer a Manual or Automatic transmission.
* Then, use the check boxes to select one or more cyclinder options.
* Lastly, use the sliders to indicate your preference ranges for Horse Power (HP) and Miles Per Gallon (MPG).

* When all selections have been made, click on the Search button to refresh the listing on the right with the cars which fit the criteria you have chosen.
